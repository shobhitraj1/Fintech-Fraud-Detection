# Fintech-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions in fintech banking systems. The project encompasses various stages including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation to build a robust fraud detection system. <br>
The project was developed for the [Statistical Machine Learning]((https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE342)) course at IIIT Delhi in Winter 2024.

**<h4>🛠️ Features:</h4>**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and transformation of financial transaction data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features that enhance the model's ability to detect fraud.
- **Model Training:** Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

**<h4>📋 Installation & Usage:</h4>**
- Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using pip.

**<h4>📙 Dataset Details:</h4>**
- `fintech-banking-fraud-transaction-jpmorgan.ipynb` : The synthetic-data used in the project is especially provided by JP Morgan for research purposes which replicate the intricacies of real transactional data.
- `fintech-banking-fraud-transaction-paysim.ipynb` : We have used the Kaggle dataset ["Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1) generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator.

**<h4>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Other Contributors:</h4>**
My IIIT Delhi batchmate Vashu also contributed in this project.
